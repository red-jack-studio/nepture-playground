# Nepture Playground

This is an open-source repository that can be used to interact and test private and public Nepture API Servers.

The Nepture API is a powerful service that enables highly customizable AI interactions and training. Nepture-powered AI engines can be trained using your own business data and information to perform very specialized tasks and help with automation and productivity enhancement.

Some examples of how the Nepture API can be used in a business context:

- Highly trained AIs can help with direct customer support, offering a comprehensive support experience to customers with 24/7 availability and response in real time.
- Nepture-powered AIs can be used to process multiple resolved support tickets and a vast knowledge base in real time and all at once, in order to help support analysts to find solutions to common issues faced by your clients.
- You can integrate Nepture API to your business' website to interact directly with your clients to make quotes and estimates of your products with pre-determined pricing parameters.
- Nepture-powered AIs can be used to automate writing, content creation, and translation tasks, helping business to work with a more efficient and lean overhead count.
